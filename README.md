## Use Cases

### For Property Buyers
```python
# Evaluate if a property is worth the asking price
buyer_insights = insight_generator.generate_buyer_insights(
    property,
    budget=500000
)

# Get negotiation tips based on market conditions
print("Negotiation Tips:")
for tip in buyer_insights['negotiation_tips']:
    print(f"  ‚Ä¢ {tip}")

# See future value projections
projections = buyer_insights['future_projections']
print(f"1-Year Value: ${projections['1_year']:,.0f}")
print(f"3-Year Value: ${projections['3_year']:,.0f}")
```

### For Property Sellers
```python
# Get optimal pricing strategy
seller_insights = insight_generator.generate_seller_insights(property)

pricing = seller_insights['pricing_strategy']
print(f"Recommended Price: ${pricing['recommended_list_price']:,.0f}")
print(f"Strategy: {pricing['strategy']}")

# Estimate time to sell
print(f"Estimated Days on Market: {seller_insights['estimated_days_on_market']}")
```

### For Investors
```python
# Find high-potential investment opportunities
investment_goals = {
    "min_roi": 15.0,
    "risk_tolerance": "medium",
    "time_horizon": "medium"
}

investor_insights = insight_generator.generate_investor_insights(
    budget=2000000,
    investment_goals=investment_goals
)

# Review top opportunities
for opp in investor_insights['top_opportunities']:
    print(f"Location: {opp['location']}")
    print(f"Opportunity Score: {opp['opportunity_score']}/100")
    print(f"Expected ROI: {opp['predicted_roi']:.2f}%")
    print(f"Risk Level: {opp['risk_level']}")
```

### Market Analysis
```python
# Analyze market trends
trend = market_analyzer.analyze_market_trend("Downtown", period_months=12)
print(f"Trend: {trend.trend_direction}")
print(f"Price Change: {trend.price_change_percent:+.2f}%")

# Calculate market heat
heat_index = market_analyzer.calculate_market_heat_index("Downtown")
print(f"Market Heat: {heat_index:.1f}/100")

# Identify emerging markets
emerging = market_analyzer.identify_emerging_markets(min_growth_rate=5.0)
print(f"Emerging Markets: {', '.join(emerging)}")
```

## Prediction Methodology

The system uses a sophisticated multi-factor prediction model:

1. **Comparable Sales Analysis**: Finds similar properties based on type, size, and location
2. **Location Adjustment**: Applies location-specific premium/discount
3. **Property Features**: Adjusts for age, amenities, and specific characteristics
4. **Seasonal Factors**: Applies month-specific adjustments (spring/summer peak)
5. **Market Trends**: Incorporates current market momentum and direction
6. **Economic Indicators**: Factors in employment, GDP, interest rates

### Confidence Scoring
- Based on amount of comparable data available
- Historical market data depth
- Data recency and relevance
- Typical confidence levels: 70-95%

## Investment Scoring Algorithm

The investment opportunity score (0-100) considers:

- **Neighborhood Desirability (30%)**: Safety, schools, income levels, walkability
- **Market Conditions (25%)**: Heat index, velocity, demand/supply balance
- **Growth Potential (25%)**: Price appreciation trends, momentum
- **Economic Factors (20%)**: Employment rates, population growth

## Data Requirements

To use the system effectively, you need:

1. **Historical Transaction Data**: Recent sales with prices, dates, property details
2. **Market Statistics**: Median prices, inventory levels, days on market
3. **Neighborhood Data**: Demographics, crime rates, school ratings
4. **Economic Indicators**: Employment, interest rates, GDP growth (optional)
